A collection of Python scripts and functions for working on computer music.
Browse the files to see what they do, there's documentation for most functions.

To "install" just add the path to the folder to your PYTHONPATH environment
variable. In other words, extract this repository somewhere, naviagate to the
base folder of the repositoary (probably pycm/) and then do:

$export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH

You should now be able to load the files as modules when you run your Python
scripts.
